Based on a single data schema it can generate the JPA/Hibernate code for the whole service layer (from data-access code to web services) for all CRUD operations. When generating code, Cobigen is able to detect and leave untouched any code which developers have added manually.\n\n\nIn the new release it supports Spring Data for data access and it is now capable of generating the whole User Interface as well: data-grids and individual rows/records with support for filters, pagination etc.  That is to say: Cobigen can now generate automatically all the code from the server-side database access layer all the way up to the UI \"screens\" in the web browser.\n\n\nCurrently we support Sencha Ext JS with support for Angular 2 coming soon. The code generated by Cobigen can be opened and used by Sencha Architect, the visual design tool, which enables the programmer to extend and enhance the generated UI non-programmatically. When Cobigen regenerates the code, even those additions are left intact. All these features combined allow for an iterative, incremental way of development which can be up to an order of an magnitude more productive than \"programming manual\"\n\n\nCobigen can now also be used for code-generation within the context of an engagement. It is easily extensible and the process of how to extend it for your own project is well documented. This becomes already worthwhile (\"delivers ROI\") when having 5+ identical elements within the project.\n\n\nFor more information see: The Cobigen documentation\n\n\n\n"}
