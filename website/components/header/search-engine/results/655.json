The purpose of this guide is to offer quick solutions for common application security issues for all applications based on devonfw. It’s often the case that we need our systems to comply to certain sets of security requirements and standards. Each of these requirements needs to be understood, addressed and converted to code or project activity. We want this guide to prevent the wheel from being reinvented over and over again and to give clear hints and solutions to common security problems.\n\n\n\n\nThe wiki can be accessed here: https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-security/wiki\n\n\nThe PDF can be accessed here: https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-security\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
