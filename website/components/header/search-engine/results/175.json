Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nLog-monitoring is an aspect of monitoring with a strict focus on logging.\nWith trends towards IT landscapes with many but much smaller apps the classicial approach to write log-files to the disc and let operators read those via SSH became entirely obsolete.\nNowadays we have up to hundreds or even thousands of apps that themselves are clustered into multiple nodes.\nTherefore you should establish a centralized log monitoring system in the environment and let all your nodes log directly into that system.\nThis approach gives the following benefits:\n\n\n\n\nall log information available in one place\n\n\nfull-text search accross all logfiles\n\n\nability to automatically trigger alerts from specific log patterns\n\n\nability to do data-mining on logs and visualize in dashboards\n\n\n\n\n"}
