Has it been removed?\n\nThe boilerplate module has been removed from the GitHub project on purpose.\n\n\nThere were problems with naming and communication, not everybody was aware of the meaning of the word boilerplate.\n\n\nThe name of the folder has been changed to template. It can be found in the GitHub project.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to use Docker with MrChecker?\n\nMrChecker works seamlessly with Docker.\n\n\nA direct example of how to use it can be found in following JenkinsFile https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/blob/develop/mrchecker-app-under-test/pipelines/CI/Jenkinsfile_node.groovy\n\n\nNote that the structure of the folders can be changed. If that happens - search in repo for  /pipeline/CI/Jenkinsfile_node.groovy\n\n\n\nTests are not stable\n\nSelenium tests perform actions much faster than a normal user would. Because pages can contain dynamically changing content, some web elements can still not be loaded when Selenium driver tries to access them.\n\n\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded() method checks ready state in the browser, that’s why stability problems may happen in advanced frontend projects.\n\n\nTo improve test stability you can:\n\n\n\n\nadd waiting methods before dynamically loading elements e.g. getDriver().waitForElement(By selector)\n\n\nadd timeout parameter in method getDriver().findElementDynamic(By selector, int timeOut)\n\n\nchange global waiting timeout value using method getDriver().manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(long time, TimeUnit unit)\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, if the page displays visible loading bars or spinners, create FluentWait method to wait until they disappear.\n\n\nNotice that by increasing timeouts you may improve stability but too long waiting time makes tests run slower.\n\n\nLearn more from tutorials:\nExample 10: Dynamically loaded Elements\nExample 11: Exit intent\nExample 12: File download test\n\n\n\n\n"}
