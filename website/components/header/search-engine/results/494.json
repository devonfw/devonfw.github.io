The components of the framework are designed and implemented according to the recommendations and guidelines as specified by OWASP in order to confront the top 10 security vulnerabilities.\n\n\nFrom version 2.1 \"Balu\" onward we certify that devonfw has been scanned by software from \"Black Duck\". This verifies that devonfw is based on 100% Open Source Software (non Copyleft) and demonstrates that at moment of release there are no known, critical security flaws. Less critical issues are clearly documented.\n\n\n\n"}
