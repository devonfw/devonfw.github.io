The former oasp4j-ide and devonfw distributions with their extra-large gigabyte zip files are not entirely replaced with devonfw-ide. This new solution is provided as a small *.tar.gz file that is publicly available. It works on all platforms and has been tested on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. After extraction you only need to run a setup script. Here you provide a settings git URL for your customer project or simply hit return for testing or small projects. After reading and confirming the terms of use it will download all required tools in the proper versions for your operating system and configure them. Instead of various confusing scripts there is now only one CLI command devon for all use-cases what gives a much better user experience.\n\n\nTo get started go to the home page. There is even a migration-guide if you are currently used to the old approach and want to quickly jump into the new solution.\n\n\n\n"}
