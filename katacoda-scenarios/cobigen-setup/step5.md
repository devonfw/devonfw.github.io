    Selecting the menu entry Generate​ the generation wizard will be opened.
    
    The left side of the wizard shows all available increments, which can be selected to be generated. Increments are a container like concept encompassing multiple files to be generated, which should result in a semantically closed generation output. The type of modification of each file will be encoded into following color scheme if the files are selected for generation:

    - green: files, which are currently non-existent in the file system. These files will be created during generation

    - yellow: files, which are currently existent in the file system and which are configured to be merged with generated contents.

    - red: files, which are currently existent in the file system. These files will be overwritten if manually selected.

    - no color: files, which are currently existent in the file system. Additionally files, which were unselected and thus will be ignored during generation.
