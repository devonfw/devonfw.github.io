In case that such discontinuation is expected to break existing projects\na two stage deprecation mechanism is used:\n\n\n\n\nStage 1: Usage of a deprecated feature will produce a warning only giving details on\nwhat needs to be changed.\n\n\nStage 2: When a deprecated feature is used Solicitor by default will terminate with an error\nmessage giving information about the deprecation.\n\n\n\n\nBy setting the property solicitor.deprecated-features-allowed to true\n(e.g. via the command line, see Configuration of Technical Properties), even in second stage\nthe feature will still be available and only a warning will be logged. The project setup should in any\ncase ASAP be changed to no longer use the feature as it might soon be removed without further\nnotice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling the use of deprecated feature via the above property should only be\na temporary workaround and not a standard setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf usage of a feature should be discontinued immediately (e.g. because it might lead to\nwrong/misleading output) the first stage of deprecation will be skipped.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
