This includes detected Licenses, Copyrights and Notice-Files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current integration with ScanCode is experimental: The used ScanCode parameters, interfacing and curations logic and all parts of the data persistence are experimental and thus might result in insufficient quality of results. The current workflow and implementation is subject to change in future versions without further notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
