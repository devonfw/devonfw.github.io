This means we demonstrated the completed and implemented functionalities with screen sharing and the product owner accepted the completed tasks.\nWithin the User Story ICSDSHOW-22 “See all orders/reservations” the functionality “filtering the list by date” could have not been implemented during Sprint 2. The team was unsure on how to proceed with this task. One team member added that especially in regards of having a coherent release, implementing less but working functionalities is much better than implementing more but not working functionalities. For this the team reminded itself focusing on completing functionalities and not working straight to a working application.\n\n\n\n\n"}
