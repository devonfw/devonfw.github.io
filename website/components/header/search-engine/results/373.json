This logger provide the methods log, error and warn. All of those methods will write a log message, but with a different log level.\n\n\nThe winston logger has two transports: one to log everything inside the file logs/general.log and the other to log only the error logs inside the file logs/error.log. In addition, it uses the default NestJS logger in order to show the logs in the console.\n\n\nAs you can see it is a simple example about how to use logger in a devon4node application. It will be update to a complex one in the next versions.\n\n\n"}
