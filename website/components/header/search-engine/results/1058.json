There is a workspace folder main dedicated for your primary work. You may do all your work inside the main workspace. Also, you are free to create any number of additional workspace folders named as you like (e.g. test, release, testing, my-sub-project, etc.). Using multiple workspaces is especially relevant for Eclipse as each workspace has its own Eclipse runtime instance and configuration.\n\n\nWithin the workspace folder (e.g. workspaces/main) you are again free to create sub-folders for (sub-)projects according to your needs. We assume that in most cases you clone git repositories here. The following structure shows an example layout for devonfw:\n\n\nListing 5. File structure of workspaces\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the main workspace you may find the cloned forks for regular work (in the example e.g. devon4j) as a base to create pull-requests while in the stable workspace there is a clone of devon4j from the official devon4j.\nHowever, this is just an example. Some people like to create separate workspaces for development and maintenance branches with git. Other people just switch between those via git checkout.\n\n\n\n\n"}
