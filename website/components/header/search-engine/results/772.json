You can introduce some SQL injection flaws in your application and make it exploitable, but you can also expose your secrets (which will have nothing to do with code itself) due to poor secret management process, and fail as well.\n\n\nBecause of this and many other reasons, not every aspect of security can be automatically verified. Manual tests and audits will still be needed. Nevertheless, every security requirement which is automatically verified will prevent code degeneration and misconfiguration in a continuous manner.\n\n\n\nHow to test Security\n\nSecurity tests can be performed in many different ways, such as:\n\n\n\n\nStatic Code Analysis - improves the security by (usually) automated code review. A good way to search for vulnerabilities, which are 'obvious' on the code level ( e.g. SQL injection). The downside of this approach is that professional tools to perform such scans are very expensive and still produce many false positives.\n\n\nDynamic Code Analysis - tests are run against a working environment. A good way to search for vulnerabilities, which require all client- and server-side components to be present and running (like e.g. Cross-Site Scripting). Tests are performed in a semi-automated manner and require a proxy tool (like e.g. OWASP ZAP)\n\n\nUnit tests - self-written and self-maintained tests. They usually work on the HTTP/REST level (this defines the trust boundary between the client and the server) and run against a working environment. Unit tests are best suited for verifying requirements which involve business knowledge of the system or which assure secure configuration on the HTTP level.\n\n\n\n\nIn the current release of the Security Module, the main focus will be Unit Tests.\n\n\nAlthough the most common choice of environment for running security tests on will be integration(the environment offers the right stability and should mirror the production closely), it is not uncommon for some security tests to run on production as well. This is done for e.g. TLS configuration testing to ensure proper configuration of the most relevant environment in a continuous manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
