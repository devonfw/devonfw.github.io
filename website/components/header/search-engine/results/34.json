Do you only want to remember a single password for simplicity? Do you want to have both? Then, you need to install KeePass right now.\n\n\n\nReal text editor\n\nA real developer needs a real text editor and not windows built in notepad.\nThe most common choice is Notepad++.\n\n\n\nReal compression tool\n\nDo you need to deal with ZIP files, TGZ, dpkg, etc.? Just install 7zip and forget about windows build-in ZIP support (that is buggy with long file paths, etc.).\n\n\n\nSmarter clipboard\n\nDo you want to paste something from the clipboard but meanwhile you had to copy something else? Just, one of the many things you can easily do with ditto.\n\n\n\nPowerToys\n\nMicrosoft provides some extensions to improve the workflow in windows called PowerToys. The include tools like a file renamer, a way to order your windows on the screen, a color picker and more.\n\n\n\nSysinternals Tools\n\nA real developer will quickly notice that windows build in tools to analyze processes, network connections, autostarts, etc. are quite poor. So, what you really would like is the Sysinternals-Suite. You can make process-explorer your default task manager. Use autoruns to prevent nasty background things to be started automatically. Use tcpview to figure out which process is blocking port 8080, etc.\n\n\n\nCope with file locks\n\nDid you ever fail to delete a file or directory that was locked by some process and you did not even know which one it was?\nThen you might love IoBit Unlocker.\nSee also this article.\n\n\n\nCreate symbolic links\n\nAre you are used to symbolic and hard links in Linux? Do you have to work with Windows? Would you also like to have such links in Windows? Why not? Windows supports real links (not shortcuts like in other cases).\nIf you even want to have it integrated in windows explorer you might want to install linkshellextension. However, you might want to disable SmartMove in the configuration if you face strange performance issues when moving folders.\n\n\n\nLinux\n\nInstall Cygwin and get your bash in windows with ssh-agent, awk, sed, tar, and all the tools you love (or hate). Windows 10 has already a Linux as an installable feature included: WSL and from Version 2004 on WSL2, which is a native Linux Kernel running on Windows (in a light weight VM).\n\n\n\nX11\n\nDo you want to connect via SSH and need to open an X11 app from the server? Do you want to see the GUI on your windows desktop?\nNo problem: Install VcXsrv.\n\n\n\nKeyboard Freak\n\nAre you a keyboard shortcut person? Do you want to have shortcuts for things like « and » ?\nThen you should try AutoHotKey.\nFor the example (« and ») you can simply use this script to get started:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, just press [ctrl][&lt;] and [ctrl][&gt;] ([ctrl][shift][&lt;]). Next, create shortcuts to launch your IDE, to open your favorite tool, etc.\nIf you like a GUI to easily configure the scrips, that comes with a lot of extensions preinstalled, you should have a look at Ac’tive Aid.\n\n\n\nPaint anywhere on your desktop\n\nDo you collaborate sharing your screen, and want to mark a spot on top of what you see? Use Epic Pen to do just that.\n\n\n\nAnalyze graphs\n\nDo you need to visualize complex graph structures? Convert them to Trivial Graph Format (.tgf), a run yEd to get an interactive visualization of your graph.\n\n\n\nUp your screen capture game\n\nCapture any part of your screen with a single click, directly upload to dropbox, or run a svn commit all in one go with Greenshot. Another screen capture tool where you can easily manage and edit your screenshots and also do screen recordings with is Screenpresso.\n\n\n\nFast Search in Windows\n\nEverything is a desktop search utility for Windows that can rapidly find files and folders by name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
