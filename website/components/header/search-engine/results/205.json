With the application you can create, read, update and delete employees.\n\n\nIn order to start the application, run the following commands in the todo folder:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can access to the application using the url http://localhost:8081/v1/employee/employees. If you want to now all endpoints exposed, you can see the swagger at: http://localhost:8081/v1/api.\n\n\nThis is a simple example without authentication. With this example you can learn how to work with database migrations. You can find them in the folder /src/migrations. The TypeORM is configured in order to execute the migrations every time that you start this application (\"migrationsRun\": true at ormconfig.json). You can also execute the migration manually by typing the command devon4node db migration:run, or revert executing devon4node db migration:revert. Take into account that the database that this application is using is an in-memory sqlite, so every time that you stop the application all data is lost.\n\n\n\n"}
