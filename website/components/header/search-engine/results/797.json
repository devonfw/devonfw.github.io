This approach might require a lot of manual work. Solicitor therefore includes a mechanism named license url guessing which tries to guess an alternative license URL which should point to a representation of the content better suited for rendering.\n\n\nCurrently license URL guessing is based solely on the URL given in NormalizedLicense.effectiveNormalizedLicenseUrl. It will try the following approaches:\n\n\n\n\nIf the original URL is a Github-URL and matches patterns which are known to return HTML-formatted content then the URL is rewritten to point to a raw version of the content.\n\n\nIf the original URL points to a Github project page (not to a file), then the algorithm will try different typical locations (like e.g. looking for file LICENSE). If found it will return this URL as result.\n\n\nIf no \"better\" URL could be guessed it will return the original URL.\n\n\n\n\nThe result of the license URL guessing is available via three attributes:\n\n\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.guessedLicenseUrl: The (possibly) improved URL pointing to the license text.\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.guessedLicenseUrlAuditInfo: A text which gives info how the guessed url was determined (available for auditing purposes).\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.guessedLicenseContent: The content downloaded from the guessed URL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the license content (also including the checking if a certain resource is available when trying different possible filenames) is done using the same (caching) mechanisms as downloading the content for other URLs, see the previous section.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
