To do so, inside the folder environments/ the files are going to get modified adding this boolean to each environment that is going to be used. In this case, only two environments are going to be modified (environment.ts and environment.prod.ts). Down below there is an example of the modification being done in the environment.prod.ts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the file in first instance there is the declaration of the types of the variables. After that, there is the definition of those variables. This variable loadExternalConfig is going to be used by the service, allowing to setup a external config just by switching the loadExternalConfig to true.\n\n\n\n"}
