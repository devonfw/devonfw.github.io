In the integrated terminal, press Ctrl + C to terminate the running application and run the following command:\n\n\n\n\nnpm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use Yarn to install the dependencies if you prefer that:\n\n\n\n\nyarn add @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations\n\n\n\n\nOnce the dependencies are installed, we need to import the BrowserAnimationsModule in our AppModule for animations support.\n\n\nListing 88. Importing BrowserAnimationsModule in AppModule\n\n\n\n\n\nAngular Material provides a host of components for designing our application. All the components are well structured into individual NgModules. For each component from the Angular Material library that we want to use, we have to import the respective NgModule.\n\n\nListing 89. We will be using the following components in our application:\n\n\n\n\n\nA better approach is to import and then export all the required components in a shared  module. But for the sake of simplicity, we are importing all the required components in the AppModule itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we include a theme in our application. Angular Material comes with four pre-defined themes: indigo-pink, deeppurple-amber, pink-bluegrey and purple-green. It is also possible to create our own custom theme, but that is beyond the scope of this guide. Including a theme is required to apply all of the core and theme styles to your application.\nWe will include the indigo-pink theme in our application by importing the indigo-pink.css file in our src/styles.scss:\n\n\nListing 90. In src/styles.scss:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use Material Design Icons along with the mat-icon component, we will load the Material Icons library in our src/index.html file\n\n\nListing 91. In src/index.html:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
