(The Solicitor application might include a set of often used license texts and thus it is not necessary to fetch those via the net.) If the classpath does not contain the content of the URL the next step is taken.\n\n\nIf the content is found as a file in subdirectory licenses of the current working directory this is taken. If no such file exists the content is fetched via the net. The result will be written to the file directory, so any content will only be fetched once. (The user might alter the files in that directory to change/correct its content.) A file of length zero indicates that no content could be fetched.\n\n\n\n\nThe determined content is available as NormalizedLicense.effectiveNormalizedLicenseContent and NormalizedLicense.licenseRefContent\n\n\n"}
