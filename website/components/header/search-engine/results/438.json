Classic devon4j Spring applications rely on Apache CFX as the implemention of JAX-RS.\nFor Quarkus, we use RESTEasy. Since both are implementations of JAX-RS, much of the Spring application code can be reused.\n\n\nTake the definition of the REST endpoints from the api module of the Spring application (make sure to rename the transfer objects), inject the use-cases from the logic layer and use them in the REST service methods as follows:\n\n\nListing 30.
