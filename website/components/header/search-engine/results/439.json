OAQ is a JMS provider based on the Oracle RDBMS and included in the DB product for no extra fee. OAQ has some features that exceed the JMS standard like a retention time (i.e. a built-in backup mechanism that allows to make messages \"unread\" within a configurable period of time so that these messages do not have to be resent by the sending application). Also, OAQ messages are stored in relational tables so they can easily be observed by a test driver in a system test scenario.\nCapgemini has used the Spring Data JDBC Extension in order to process OAQ messages within the same technical transaction as the resulting Oracle RDBMS data changes without using 2PC and an XA-compliant transaction manager - which is not available out of the box in Tomcat. This is possible only due to the fact that OAQ queues and RDBMS tables actually reside in the same database. However, this is higher magic and should only be tried if high transaction rates must be achieved by avoiding 2PC.\n\n\n\n"}
