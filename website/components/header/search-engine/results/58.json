The screen displays all the projects in the currently selected devonfw-ide, grouped by the workspaces in which they exist.\nNote: Currently it only displays projects created through the dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt shows the total number of projects available in each devonfw-ide.\n\n\nFiltering and searching the projects.\n\n\nAdd New Project - For creating a Project.\n\n\nProject folder which gives information about the project like which technology the project belongs to, the name of the project, and when it has created.\n\n\nThere are many operations that are available on right-click on Project folder they are :\n\n\n\nOpening a project in different IDE ( Visual Studio or Eclipse )\n\n\nEnclosing Folder, and\n\n\nDeleting the project.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers can see projects of different devonfw-ide workspace just by changing the option in the devonfw instance dropdown which is set globally at the top of the screen.\n\n\n\n\nClick on Add New Project to start creating a new project.\n\n\n\nHow to create a project\n\nThree main steps are involved in creating any devonfw project. They are:\n\n\nStep 1. Project Type\n\n\nIn this first step the user has to choose the language technology to start the project with, e.g. Angular, Java or Node and click the Next button for to continue to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Project Data\n\n\nAfter the Project type selection, the second screen will appear for the user to fill up all the required fields. User can select the workspace in the active devonfw-ide for the project in this step. Once the user enters all the required fields, the Next button will be enabled for the final step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser can change the devonfw-ide workspace where the project is going to generate, just by changing the option in the devonfw instance dropdown which is set globally in the header of the dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Execution\n\n\nThe execution step takes all the user entered data from the Project Data step and executes the respective commands to generate the project.\n\n\nExecution has divided into two sections:\n- Creation\n- Setup Installation\n\n\n3.1 Creation\n\n\n\nCreates only source code and notify the user if the project creation fails or success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case any network issue or technical issue and the user wants to re-run the Project execution process, then the Retry button will help to start the process again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Setup installation\n\nAllows user to install the dependencies of application (maven modules for java, node modules for node, angular) by clicking Proceed button.\n\n\nThe installation can be skipped by clicking cancel button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Click on Finish button to go to Project Details Screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
