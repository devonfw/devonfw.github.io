Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nA JmsListener is a class listening and consuming JMS messages. It should carry the suffix JmsListener and implement the MessageListener interface or have its listener method annotated with @JmsListener. This is illustrated by the following example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey there! Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository.
