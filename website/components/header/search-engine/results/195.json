Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the implementation of the service layer, we use the JAX-RS for both Quarkus and Spring applications to create the REST services. Classic devon4j Spring applications rely on Apache CFX as the implemention of JAX-RS.\nFor Quarkus, we use RESTEasy. Since both are implementations of JAX-RS, much of the Spring application code can be reused.\n\n\nTake the definition of the REST endpoints from the api module of the Spring application (make sure to rename the transfer objects), inject the use-cases from the logic layer and use them in the REST service methods as follows:\n\n\nListing 30. REST service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
