It should carry the suffix JmsListener and implement the MessageListener interface or have its listener method annotated with @JmsListener. This is illustrated by the following example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSender\n\nThe sending of JMS messages is considered as any other sending of data like kafka messages or RPC calls via REST using service-client, gRPC, etc.\nThis will typically happen directly from a use-case in the logic-layer.\nHowever, the technical complexity of the communication and protocols itself shall be hidden from the use-case and not be part of the logic layer.\nWith spring we can simply use JmsTemplate to do that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
