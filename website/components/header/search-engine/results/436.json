It is suitable for events such as an HTTP request with its URL, resulting status code and duration in milliseconds. Your monitoring may not react to such data in realtime. Instead it may take a delay of one or a few seconds.\n\n\nInfrastructure monitoring\nis about monitoring the (hardware) infrastructure with measures like usage of CPU, memory, disc-space, etc. This is a pure operational task and your app should have nothing to do with this. In other words it is a waste if your app tries to monitor these aspects as existing products can do this much better and your app will only see virtual machines and is unable to see the physical infrastructure.\n\n\nHealth check\nis about providing internal data about the current health of your app. Typically you provide sensors with health status per component or interface to neighbour service (database connectivity, etc.).\n\n\nApplication Performance Monitoring\nis about measuring performance and tracing down performance issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
