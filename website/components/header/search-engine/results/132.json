Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are developing Javascript client and server application separately, you have to deal with cross domain issues. We have to request from a origin domain distinct to target domain and browser does not allow this.\n\n\nSo , we need to prepare server side to accept request from other domains. We need to cover the following points:\n\n\n\n\nAccept request from other domains.\n\n\nAccept devonfw used headers like X-CSRF-TOKEN or correlationId.\n\n\nBe prepared to receive secured request (cookies).\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that if you are using security in your request (sending cookies) you have to set  withCredentials flag to true in your client side request and deal with special IE8 characteristics.\n\n\nFor more information about CORS see here. Information about the CORS headers can be found here.\n\n\n"}
