JIRA is equipped with several of useful tools regarding the agile software development (e.g. Scrum-Board). One of the big advantages of JIRA are the extensive configuration and personalization possibilities.\nWith having a list of the Epics and User Stories for the My Thai Star development in GitHub, the team transferred the User Stories into the JIRA backlog as it is shown in the screenshot below. All User Stories are labeled colorfully with the related Epic which shapes the backlog in clearly manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 92. Screenshot of the JIRA backlog during Sprint 2\n\n\nWe decided on working with Subtask as a single user story comprised a number of single and separated tasks. Another benefit of working with Subtask is that every single Subtask can be assigned to a single team member whereas a user story can only be assigned to one team member. By picking single Subtask the whole process of a user story is better organized.\n\n\nScreenshots of Sub tasks during Sprint 2\nimage::images/methodology_3.png[Screenshot of Subtasks, width=\"450\", link=\"images/methodology_03.png\"]\n\n\n\n"}
