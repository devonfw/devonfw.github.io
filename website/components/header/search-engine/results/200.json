Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository.

OpenAPI allows REST APIs to be defined in a uniform manner.\nTechnically, an OpenAPI document is written in YAML or JSON format. The specification defines the structure of a REST API by describing attributes such as path information, response codes, and return types. Some examples can be found here.\nApart from documenting the API, this schema then also acts as a contract between provider and consumers, guaranteeing interoperability between various technologies.\n\n\nOpenAPI is often used in combination with Swagger. Swagger is a set of tools build around OpenAPI, that help developers to design and document their REST APIs.\nThe most common tool is the Swagger UI, which uses the OpenAPI specification to create a graphical interface of the REST API that you can also interact with. Check out the Swagger online editor to get a feeling for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nHey there! Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository.

Swagger 2.0 is still commonly used for describing APIs. OpenAPI is an open-source collaboration and it started from version 3.0.0(semver)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nHey there!
