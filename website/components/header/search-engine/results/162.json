Log-levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog-level\nDescription\nImpact\nActive Environments\n\n\n\n\nFATAL\nOnly used for fatal errors that prevent the application to work at all (e.g. startup fails or shutdown/restart required)\nOperator has to react immediately\nall\n\n\nERROR\nAn abnormal error indicating that the processing failed due to technical problems.\nOperator should check for known issue and otherwise inform development\nall\n\n\nWARNING\nA situation where something worked not as expected. E.g. a business exception or user validation failure occurred.\nNo direct reaction required. Used for problem analysis.\nall\n\n\nINFO\nImportant information such as context, duration, success/failure of request or process\nNo direct reaction required. Used for analysis.\nall\n\n\nDEBUG\nDevelopment information that provides additional context for debugging problems.\nNo direct reaction required. Used for analysis.\ndevelopment and testing\n\n\nTRACE\nLike DEBUG but exhaustive information and for code that is run very frequently. Will typically cause large log-files.\nNo direct reaction required. Used for problem analysis.\nnone (turned off by default)\n\n\n\n\nExceptions (with their stack trace) should only be logged on FATAL or ERROR level. For business exceptions typically a WARNING including the message of the exception is sufficient.\n\n\nConfiguration of Logback\n\nThe configuration of logback happens via the logback.xml file that you should place into src/main/resources of your app.\nFor details consult the logback configuration manual.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nLogback also allows to overrule the configuration with a logback-test.xml file that you may put into src/test/resources or into a test-dependency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration in Quarkus\n\nThe are several options you can set in the application.properties file to configure the behaviour of the logger in Quarkus. For a detailed overview, see the corresponding part of the Quarkus guide.\n\n\n\n\n"}
