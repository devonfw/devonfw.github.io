It contains the local repository folder used as cache for artifacts downloaded and installed by maven (see also maven repositories).\nFurther, there are two configuration files for maven:\n\n\n\n\nsettings.xml initialized from a template from your devonfw-ide settings. You may customize this to your needs (configuring HTTP proxies, credentials, or other user-specific settings). Secrets can be specified as $[«variable.name»] and will be prompted, encrypted and replaced automatically during the setup (unless in batch mode). In case your credentials have changed or you made a typo, you can simply redo this step by first moving your ${DEVON_IDE_HOME}/conf/.m2/settings.xml file to a temporary folder and then calling devon mvn setup.\n\n\nsettings-security.xml is auto-generated for you by devonfw-ide with a random password. This should make it easier for devonfw-ide users to use password encryption and never add passwords in plain text for better security.\n\n\n\n\nFinally,there is a file variables for the user-specific configuration of devonfw-ide.\n\n\n\n\n"}
