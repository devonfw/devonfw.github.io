Here are some highlights you should not miss:\n\n\n\ndevonfw-ide\n\nThe devonfw-ide sets up an isolated development environment on your machine.\nAll tools you’re using are locally installed in that isolated environment, so that your installations are not conflicting with different versions from other projects.\nIf needed you can even define the look of the environment in a central space and share it with your teammates so your onboarding of new developers is rapidly speed up and a consistent development experience is guaranteed.\n\nCobiGen\n\nCobiGen is the smart generator you do not want to miss once used. Instead of generating plain files from a static model, it identifies the context from which you want to generate certain things. Image you could click on an Entity in your application and generate the repository, the TOs and the mappers out of it. CobiGen will do so.\n\nSolicitor\n\nEvery project we’ve seen in the last decades has a lot of open source software usage.\nBut the least of them keep track of the license obligations or do at all provide any kind of catalog what tools are in use.\nSolicitor creates an inventory of your software and evaluates them based on a defined rule set.\n\n\n\n\nJump In\n\n\nYou’re asking yourself now \"Wow that’s pretty cool, how can I use it?\".\nWe thought you would and prepared some Katacoda tutorials for you.\n\n\nWe recommend to start with the JumpTheQueue  scenario. You can start by following the steps of the tutorial on the github repository or with our interactive tutorial\n\n\nJumpTheQueue Katacoda Scenario\n\n\nIf you’re interested in a real world example completely build with devonfw, take a look at our sample application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should I use devonfw?\n\n\nExplore Our devonfw Sample Application\n\n\nRepository Overview\n\n\n\n\n"}
