Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn application needs to be configurable in order to allow internal setup (like CDI) but also to allow externalized configuration of a deployed package (e.g. integration into runtime environment). We rely on a comprehensive configuration approach following a \"convention over configuration\" pattern. This guide adds on to this by detailed instructions and best-practices how to deal with configurations.\n\n\nIn general we distinguish the following kinds of configuration that are explained in the following sections:\n\n\n\n\nInternal Application configuration maintained by developers\n\n\nExternalized Environment configuration maintained by operators\n\n\nExternalized Business configuration maintained by business administrators\n\n\n\n\n"}
