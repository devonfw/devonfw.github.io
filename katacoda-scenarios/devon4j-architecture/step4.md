### Key Principles:
devon4j application follows some fundamental principles  for all decisions about architecture, design, or choosing standards, libraries, and frameworks. 
It follows key principles such as KISS, open,patterns, solid. More detils can be found [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#key-principles).

### Architecture Principles:
Additionally devon4j architecture is based on [architecture principles](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#architecture-principles) such as Component Oriented Design, Homogeneity.

### Application Architecture:

For the architecture of an application we distinguish the following views:

* The **Business Architecture** describes an application from the business perspective. It divides the application into business components and with full abstraction of technical aspects.

* The **Technical Architecture** describes an application from the technical implementation perspective. It divides the application into technical layers and defines which technical products and frameworks are used to support these layers.

* The **Infrastructure Architecture** describes an application from the operational infrastructure perspective. It defines the nodes used to run the application including clustering, load-balancing and networking. This view is not explored further in this guide.
