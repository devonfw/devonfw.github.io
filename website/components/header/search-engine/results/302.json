Component decomposition example before\n\n\nWhat should be done, is to define small reusable Dumb Components.\nThis way the complexity becomes manageable.\nIn the example every colored box describes a component with the purple box being a Smart Component.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 43. Component decomposition example after\n\n\nThis leads to the following component tree.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 44. Component decomposition example component tree\n\n\nNote the uppermost component is a Dumb Component.\nIt is a wrapper for the label and the component to be displayed inside a form.\nThe Smart Component is Listpicker.\nThis way the widget can be reused without a form needed.\n\n\nA widgets is a typical Smart Component to be shared across feature modules.\nSo the SharedModule is the place for it to be defined.\n\n\n\n"}
