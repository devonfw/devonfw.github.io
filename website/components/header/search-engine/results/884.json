Again this phase comprises two decision tables.\n\n\nPre-Evaluation based on common rules\n\nWithin the pre evaluation the license info is checked against standard OSS usage policies. This roughly qualifies the usage and might already determine licenses which are OK in any case or which need to be further evaluated. Furthermore, they qualify whether the license text or source code needs to be included in the distribution. The rules in this decision table are only based on the effectiveNormalizedLicense and do not consider any project, application of component information.\n\n\nDecision table data: LegalPreEvaluation*.xls/csv\n\n\n\n\nLHS condition:\n\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.effectiveNormalizedLicenseType\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.effectiveNormalizedLicense\n\n\n\n\n\nRHS result:\n\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.legalPreApproved\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.copyLeft\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.licenseCompliance\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.licenseRefUrl\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.includeLicense\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.includeSource\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal evaluation\n\nThe decision table for final legal evaluation defines all rules which are needed\nto create the result of the legal evaluation.
