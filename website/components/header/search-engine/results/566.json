With this, we can ensure that the ConfigurationService and the environment files has those property at compiling time.\n\n\nAdd the new property getter to ConfigurationService. You must use the get method of ConfigurationService to ensure that the property will be loaded from the desired config file. You can also add extra logic if needed.\n\n\nAdd the property to all config files inside the src/config folder.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nWe want to add the property devonfwUrl to our ConfigurationService, so:\n\n\nWe add the following code in IConfig interface:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, we add the getter in the ConfigurationService:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we add the definition in all config files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
