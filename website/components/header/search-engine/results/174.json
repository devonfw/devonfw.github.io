As a result, it starts up lightning fast and consumes much less memory. This is a great advantage for cloud deployment as well as for sustainability. You can find a performance comparison between Spring and Quarkus here.\n\n\nclean and lean\nAs quarkus was born as a cloud-native framework, it is very light-weight and does not carry much history and legacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
