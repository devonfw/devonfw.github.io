When using a logger, specify the generic-type alternative ILogger&lt;TCategoryName&gt; or register the ILogger with dependency injection (DI).\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault .Net log levels system:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\nCritical\nUsed to notify failures that force the program to shut down\n\n\nError\nUsed to track major faults that occur during program execution\n\n\nWarning\nUsed to report non-critical unexpected behavior\n\n\nInformation\nInformative messages\n\n\nDebug\nUsed for debugging messages containing additional information about application operations\n\n\nTrace\nFor tracing the code\n\n\nNone\nIf you choose this option the loggin category will not write any messages\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nComponent setup is done in the appsettings.{environment}.json file using the following structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\nUseLogFile: When you set this option to true, you can store the log output to a file.\n\n\nUseSQLiteDb: True when you wish to insert the log output into a SQLiteDb\n\n\nUseGrayLog: This option enables the use of GrayLog for loggin\n\n\nUseAOPTrace: True if you need to trace the attributes of the controllers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t set to true on production environments, doing so may expose critical information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogLevel: Sets the minimum level of logs to be captured\n\n\nSqliteDatabase: path to SQlite database\n\n\nLogFile: path to the log file\n\n\nSeqLogServerHost: url for Seq server, you need to install Seq  in order to use it, you can install it clicking here\n\n\nGrayLog: Some configuration parameters for Graylog service you can install it using this link\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up in Devon\n\nFor setting it up using the Devon4NetApi template just configure it in the appsettings.Development.json file.\n\n\nYou can use the methods implemented in Devon4NetLogger class, each method corresponds with a log level in .Net log levels system, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up in other projects\n\nInstall the package on your solution using the Package Manager Console:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following line of code to Progam.cs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the default configuration shown in the configuration section.\n\n\nuse the Devon4NetLogger class methods as explanied above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
