Therefore the JPA vendor will provide a list with lazy initialized instances of IngredientEntity that only contain the ID of that entity. Now with every call of ingredient.getPrice() we technically trigger an SQL query statement to load the specific IngredientEntity by its ID from the database.\nNow findDishById caused 1 initial query statement and for any number N of ingredients we are causing an additional query statement. This makes a total of N+1 statements. As causing statements to the database is an expensive operation with a lot of overhead (creating connection, etc.) this ends in bad performance and is therefore a problem (the N+1 Problem).\n\n\n\nSolving N plus 1 Problem\n\nTo solve the N+1 Problem you need to change your code to only trigger a single statement instead. This can be archived in various ways. The most universal solution is to use FETCH JOIN in order to pre-load the nested N child entities into the first level cache of the JPA vendor implementation. This will behave very similar as if the @ManyToMany relation to IngredientEntity was having FetchType.EAGER but only for the specific query and not in general. Because changing @ManyToMany to FetchType.EAGER would cause bad performance for other usecases where only the dish but not its extra ingredients are needed. For this reason all relations, including @OneToOne should always be FetchType.LAZY. Back to our example we simply replace dao.findDishById(dishId) with dao.findDishWithExtrasById(dishId) that we implement by the following JPQL query:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the code does not have to be changed but now dish.getExtras() will get the IngredientEntity from the first level cache where is was fetched by the initial query above.\n\n\nPlease note that if you only need the sum of the prices from the extras you can also create a query using an aggregator function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see you need to understand the concepts in order to get good performance.\n\n\nThere are many advanced topics such as creating database indexes or calculating statistics for the query optimizer to get the best performance. For such advanced topics we recommend to have a database expert in your team that cares about such things. However, understanding the N+1 Problem and its solutions is something that every Java developer in the team needs to understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nHey there!
