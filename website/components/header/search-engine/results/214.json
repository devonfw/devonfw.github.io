The app presents 3 pages as follows:\n\n\n\n\nA leader board with the top 3 elements\n\n\nA data table with all the elements\n\n\nA details page that reads a route parameter and displays the details of the element.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of business cases which have these requirements:\n\n\n\n\nA leader board can be understood as \"the most popular items in a set\", \"the latest updated items\", \"you favorite items\" etc.\n\n\nA data table with CRUD operations is very useful (in our case we only view details or delete an item, but they illustrate two important things: the details view shows how to navigate and consume a parametric route, the delete action shows how to invoke service operations over the loaded data - this means that the component is reusable and when the data comes with and API, only the service will need it’s implementation changed)\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the angular-mock-service sample from the apps folder and easily get started with front-end development using dummy data.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
