Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of a devon4j application is divided into the following modules:\n\n\n\n\napi: module containing the API of your application. The API contains the required artifacts to interact with your application via remote services. This can be REST service interfaces, transfer-objects with their interfaces and datatypes but also OpenAPI or gRPC contracts.\n\n\ncore: maven module containing the core of the application with service implementation, as well as entire logic layer and dataaccess layer.\n\n\nbatch: optional module for batch layer\n\n\nserver: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) typically as a bootified WAR file.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
