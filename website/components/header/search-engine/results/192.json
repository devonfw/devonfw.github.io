Testing a simple services with Isolated unit tests\n\n\n\n\n\nFor testing Use Case services the Angular Testing Utilities should be used.\nThe following listing gives an example.\n\n\nListing 85. Test setup for testing use case services with Angular Testing Utilities\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using TestBed, it is important\n\n\n\n\nto import HttpClientTestingModule for stubbing the backend\n\n\nto import RouterTestingModule for stubbing the Angular router\n\n\nnot to stub stores, adapters and business services\n\n\nto stub services from libraries like FlightCalculationService - the correct implementation of libraries should not be tested by these tests.\n\n\n\n\nTesting backend communication looks like this:\n\n\nListing 86. Testing backend communication with Angular HttpTestingController\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first test assures a correct XHR request is performed if initializePrintDialog() is called and no data is in the store.\nThe second test assures no XHR request IST performed if the needed data is already in the store.\n\n\nThe next steps are checks for the correct implementation of logic.\n\n\nListing 87.
