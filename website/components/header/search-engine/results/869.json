Writers only differ in the\nway how the output document is created based on a template and the reporting table data\nobtained by the SQL transformation.\n\n\nVelocity Writer\n\nThe Velocity Writer uses the Apache Velocity Templating Engine\nto create text based reports. The reporting data tables created by the SQL transformation are\ndirectly put to the into Velocity Context.\n\n\nFor further information see the\n\n\n\n\nVelocity Documentation\n\n\nThe Solicitor JavaDoc (which also includes datails on how to access the diff information for rows and fields of reporting data tables)\n\n\nThe samples included in Solicitor\n\n\n\n\n\nExcel Writer\n\nUsing Placeholders in Excel Spreadsheets\n\nWithin Excel spreadsheet templates there are two kinds of placeholders / markers possible, which control the processing:\n\n\n\nIterator Control\n\nThe templating logic searches within the XLSX workbook for fields containing the names of the\nreporting data tables as defined in the Writer configuration like e.g.:\n\n\n\n\n#ENGAGEMENT#\n\n\n#LICENSE#\n\n\n\n\nWhenever such a string is found in a cell this indicates that this row is a template row. For each entry in the respective resporting data table a copy of this row is created and the attribute replacement will be done with the data from that reporting table. (The pattern #…​# will be removed when copying.)\n\n\n\nAttribute replacement\n\nWithin each row which was copied in the previous step the templating logic searches for the string pattern $someAttributeName$ where someAttributeName corresponds to the column names of the reporting table. Any such occurence is replaced with the corresponding data value.\n\n\n\nRepresentation of Diff Information\n\nIn case that a difference processing (new vs. old model data) was done this will be represented\nas follows when using the XLS templating:\n\n\n\n\nFor rows that are \"new\" (so no corresponding old row available) an Excel note indicating that this row is new will be attached to the field that contained the #…​# placeholder.\n\n\nFields in non-new rows that have changed their value will be marked with an Excel note indicating the old value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
