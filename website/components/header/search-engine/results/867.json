The difference is calculated on the result of the above described SQL statements:\n\n\n\n\nFirst the internal reporting database is created for the current data model and all defined SQL statements are executed\n\n\nThen the internal database is recreated for the \"old\" data model and all defined SQL stements are executed again\n\n\nFinally for each defined result table the difference between the current result and the \"old\" result\nis calculated\n\n\n\n\nTo correctly correlate corresponding rows of the two different versions of table data it is necessary to define explicit correlation keys for each table in the SQL select statement.\nIt is possible to define up to 10 correlation keys named CORR_KEY_X with X in the range from 0 to 9. CORR_KEY_0 has highest priority, CORR_KEY_9 has lowest priority.\n\n\nThe correlation algorithm will first try to match rows using CORR_KEY_0. It will then attempt to correlate unmatched rows using CORR_KEY_1 e.t.c.. Correlation will stop, when\n\n\n\n\nall correlations keys CORR_KEY_0 to CORR_KEY_9 have been processed OR\n\n\nthe required correlation key column does not exist in the SQL select result OR\n\n\nthere are no unmatched \"new\" rows OR\n\n\nthere are no unmatched \"old\" rows\n\n\n\n\nThe result of the correlation / difference calulation is stored in the reporting table data structure. For each row the status is accessible if\n\n\n\n\nThe row is \"new\" (did not exist in the old data)\n\n\nThe row is unchanged (no changes in the field values representing the properties of the Solicitor data model)\n\n\nThe row is changed (at least one field corresponding to the Solicitor data model changed)\n\n\n\n\nFor each field of \"changed\" or \"unchanged\" rows the following status is available:\n\n\n\n\nField is \"changed\"\n\n\nField is \"unchanged\"\n\n\n\n\nFor each field of such rows it is furtheron possible to access the new and the old field value.\n\n\n\n"}
