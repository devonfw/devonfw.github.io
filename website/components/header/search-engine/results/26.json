You can get a free open-source edition for your desktop from here.\n\n\nObjectAid is a nice and easy to use eclipse plugin that you can use to quickly create UML diagrams from existing code. While class-diagrams are supported for free, you need to buy a license if you want to use the other diagram types.\n\n\nPlantUML is a great tool that can render UML diagrams from simple markup that can be easily managed in git or other version-control systems together with your code. Its simplicity allows branching and merging unlike other greedy binary UML data-formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
