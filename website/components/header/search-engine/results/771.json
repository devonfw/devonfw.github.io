Setting up these tools manually can be tedious and error-prone. Furthermore, some projects may require different versions and configurations of such tools. Especially configurations like code-formatters should be consistent within a project to avoid diff-wars.\n\n\nThe devonfw-ide will solve these issues. Here are the features you will find through devonfw-ide:\n\n\n\n\nEfficient\nSet up your IDE within minutes tailored for the requirements of your project.\n\n\nAutomated\nAutomate the setup and update, avoid manual steps and mistakes.\n\n\nSimple\nKISS (Keep It Small and Simple), no native installers that globally mess your OS or tool-integration that break with every release. Instead, use templates and simple shell scripts.\n\n\nConfigurable\nYou can change the configuration depending on your needs. Furthermore, the settings contain configuration templates for the different tools (see configurator).\n\n\nMaintainable\nFor your project you should copy these settings to an own git repository that can be maintained and updated to manage the tool configurations during the project lifecycle. If you use GitHub or GitLab every developer can easily suggest changes and improvements to these settings via pull/merge requests, which is easier to manage with big teams.\n\n\nCustomizable\nDo you need an additional tool you had never heard of before? Put it in the software folder of the structure. The devon CLI will then automatically add it to your PATH variable.\nFurther you can create your own commandlet for your additional tool. For closed-source tools you can create your own archive and distribute it to your team members as long as you care about the terms and licenses of these tools.\n\n\nMulti-platform\nIt works on all major platforms: Windows, Mac and Linux.\n\n\nMulti-tenancy\nYou can have several instances of the devonfw-ide \"installed\" on your machine for different projects with different tools, tool versions and configurations. You won’t need to set up any physical installation nor changing your operating system. \"Installations\" of devonfw-ide do not interfere with each other nor with other installed software.\n\n\nMultiple Workspaces\nIt supports working with different workspaces on different branches. You can create and update new workspaces with a few clicks. You can see the workspace name in the title-bar of your IDE so you do not get confused and work on the right branch.\n\n\nFree\nThe devonfw-ide is free just like everything from devonfw. See LICENSE for details.\n\n\n\n\n"}
