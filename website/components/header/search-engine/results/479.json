It can be used by the engagements to integrate with their proprietary tool chain.\n\n\nIn this new release we have added an optional graphical user interface (with integrated help) which makes using Devcon even easier to use. Another new feature is that it is now possible to easily extend it with commands just by adding your own or project specific Javascript files. This makes it an attractive option for project task automation.\n\n\n\n"}
