# Create the tutorial

Each tutorial is located in its own directory and consists of an asciidoc file, in which the tutorial is specified. The file is always named &#39;index.asciidoc&#39;.

So create a new folder in inside the tutorials directory and the file for the tutorial.


If the parent directories aren't already in the project, 'mkdir -p' will create them for you. 

`mkdir -p /root/tutorials/myTutorial`{{execute T1}}

Switch to the IDE and click 'Copy to Editor'. 

'index.asciidoc' will be created automatically inside the newly created folder.

<pre class="file" data-filename="tutorials/myTutorial/index.asciidoc">

</pre>
