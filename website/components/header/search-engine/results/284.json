This is going to allow to load the config desired by the context, in case that it is using docker to load the app or in case it loads the app with angular. Loading different files is made possible by the fact that the ConfigService method loadExternalConfig() looks for the path /config.\n\n\nDocker (Optional)\n\n1.- This step is going to be for docker. Add docker-external-config.json to nginx configuration (/nginx.conf) that is in the root of the application:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal Configuration\n\n1.- Now the file /proxy.conf.json, needs to be created/modified this file can be found in the root of the application. In this file you can add the route of the external configuration in target and the name of the file in ^/config::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.- The file package.json found in the root of the application is gonna use the start script to load the proxy config that was just created :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using Nx, you need to run the command manually:\n\n\nnx run angular-app-initializer:serve:development --proxyConfig=proxy.conf.json --o\n\n\n\n\n"}
