These are explained by the following table:\n\n\nTable 11. Usage of devon ide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument(s)\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nsetup [«SETTINGS_URL»]\nsetup devonfw-ide (cloning the settings from the given URL, optionally from specific branch URL#branch)\n\n\nupdate [«package»]\nupdate devonfw-ide\n\n\nupdate scripts [to «version»]\nupdate devonfw-ide\n\n\nuninstall\nuninstall devonfw-ide (if you want remote it entirely from your system)\n\n\n\n\nsetup\n\nRun devon ide setup to initially setup your devonfw-ide. It is recommended to run the setup script in the top-level directory ($DEVON_IDE_HOME). However, in case you want to skip some system specific integration, you may also run this command directly instead. The setup only needs to be called once after a new devonfw-ide instance has been created. It will follow this process:\n\n\n\n\ninstall the devon command on your system (if not already installed).\n\n\nclone the settings (you may provide a git URL directly as argument or you will be prompted for it).\n\n\ninstall all required software from DEVON_IDE_TOOLS variable (if not already installed).\n\n\nconfigure all these tools\n\n\ncreate IDE launch scripts\n\n\nperform OS specific system integration such as Windows Explorer integration (only done from setup script and not from devon ide setup)\n\n\n\n\n\nupdate\n\nRun devon ide update to update your devonfw-ide. This will check for updates and install them automatically.\nThe optional extra argument («package») behaves as follows:\n\n\n\n\nscripts: check if a new version of devonfw-ide-scripts is available. If so it will be downloaded and installed. As Windows is using file-locks, it is tricky to update a script while it is executed. Therefore, we update the scripts folder as an async background task and have to abort further processing at this point on windows as a workaround.\n\n\nsettings: update the settings (git pull).\n\n\nsoftware: update the software (e.g. if versions have changed via scripts or settings update).\n\n\nprojects: update the projects (checkout and import repositories into workspace/IDEs).\n\n\nall: do all the above sequentially.\n\n\nnone: settings and software are updated by default if no extra argument is given. This is the regular usage for project developers. Only perform an update of scripts when you are requested to do so by your technical lead. Bigger projects especially need to test updates before rolling them out to the entire team. If developers always updated the latest release of the scripts which is released globally, some project functionality would break causing problems and extra efforts in the teams.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to update to a specific version of scripts an explicit version can be specified after the additional to argument:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above example will update to the exact version 3.1.99 no matter if this is an upgrade or a downgrade of your current installed version.\nIf you just use devon ide update scripts then the latest available version will be installed. In larger teams it is recommended to communicate exact version updates to avoid that a new release can interfere and break anything. Therefore, some pilot user will test a new version for the entire team and, only after a successful test, they will communicate to the team to update to that exact version by providing the complete command as in the above example.\n\n\n\nuninstall\n\nWe hope you love devonfw-ide. However, if you don’t and want to get rid of it entirely and completely remove all integration, you can use this command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will remove devonfw-ide from all central places of your OS (user home directory such as scripts, .devon, .bashrc, as well as windows registry, etc.).\nHowever, it will not remove your current installations (or shared software folder). So after running this uninstall, simply remove your DEVON_IDE_HOME directory of all devonfw-ide installations and potential shared software folder. You may also want to clean up your ~/Downloads directory from files downloaded by devonfw-ide. We do not automate this as deleting a directory is a very simple manual step and we do not want to take responsibility for severe data loss if your workspaces contained valuable work.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
