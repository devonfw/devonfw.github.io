There are different ways that can be used to control the errors, here are a few:\n\n\n\n\nCreating a custom page and using with Router to redirect to a page showing an error.\n\n\nCreating a service in the server side or Backend to create a log with the error and calling it with HttpClient.\n\n\nShowing a custom made SnackBar with the error message.\n\n\n\n\nUsing SnackBarService and NgZone\n\nIf the SnackBar is used directly, some errors can occur, this is due to SnackBar being out of the Angular zone. In order to use this service properly, NgZone is necessary. The method run() from NgZone will allow the service to be inside the Angular Zone. An example on how to use it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Injector the MatSnackBar is obtained, then the correct message is obtained inside the switch. Finally, using NgZone and run(), we open the SnackBar passing the message, and the parameters wanted.\n\n\nYou can find a working example of this guide in devon4ts-samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
