It is based on Sencha Ext JS. As it requires a license for commercial applications it is not provided as Open Source and is considered to be part of the IP of Capgemini.\n\n\nThese libraries provide support for creating SPA (Single Page Applications) with a very rich set of components for both desktop and mobile. In the new version we extend this functionality to support for \"Universal Apps\", the Sencha specific term for true multi-device applications which make it possible to develop a single application for desktop, tablet as well as mobile devices. In the latest version Devon4Sencha has been upgraded to support Ext JS 6.2 and we now support the usage of Cobigen as well as Sencha Architect as extra option to improve developer productivity.\n\n\n\n"}
