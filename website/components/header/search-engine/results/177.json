Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"API\" for logging to a log-monitoring system for your app is pretty simple:\n\n\n\n\nWrite your logs to standard out.\n\n\nUse JSON logging as format.\n\n\n\n\nThen the container infrastructure can automatically collect your logs from standard out and directly feed those into the log monitoring system.\nAs a result, your app does not need to know anything about your log monitoring system and logging becomes most simple.\nFurther, if you do not write log-files anymore, you might not need to write any other files and therefore may not even need write permissions on the filesystem of your container.\nIn such case an attacker who may find a vulnerability in your app will have less attack surface in case he can not write any file.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
