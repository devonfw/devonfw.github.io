If module B reexport Module C and Module D, they are also accessible by Module A.\n\n\nIf there is a conflict with the injection token, it resolves the provider with less distance with the module. For example: if the modules C and F exports a UserService provider, the Module A will resolve the UserService exported by the Module F, because the distance from Module A to Module F is 1, and the distance from Module A to Module C is 2.\n\n\nWhen you define a module as global, the dependency injection system is the same. The only difference is now all modules as a link to the global module. For example, if we make the Module C as global the dependency graph will be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
