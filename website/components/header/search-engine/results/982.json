It is an automated testing framework for functional testing of web applications, API web services, Service Virtualization, Security, native mobile apps and, in the near future, databases. All modules have tangible examples of how to build resilient integration test cases based on delivered functions. Two new modules are added to MrChecker:\n\n\n\n\nDB Module - we have created a module intended to make testing efforts on DBs easier. It is founded on JPA in conjunction with Hibernate and therefore supports both high level, object based access to DB entities via the IDao interface and low level, native SQL commands via the EntityManager class .\n\n\nCLI Module - we have created a module intended to make testing command line applications like compilers or batches easier and faster. Huge success here is that, team using this solution was able to prepare a test suite, without app provided, basing only on documentation and using mocking technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
