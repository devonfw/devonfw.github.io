All modules have tangible examples of how to build resilient integration test cases based on delivered functions. Mr.Checker updates and improvements:\n\n\n\n\nExamples available under embedded project “MrChecker-App-Under-Test” and in project wiki: https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki\n\n\nHow to install:\n\n\n\nWiki : https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki/How-to-install\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Note:\n\n\n\nmodule selenium - 3.8.1.13:\n\n\n\nheadless browser\n\n\nenable browser options\n\n\n\n\n\nmodule DevOps :\n\n\n\nJenkinsfile align with ProductionLine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestar\n\nWe have added Test*, Testar, as an incubator to the available test tools within devonfw. This ground-breaking tool is being developed by the Technical University of Valencia (UPV). In 2019 Capgemini will co-develop Testar with the UPV.\n\n\nTestar is a tool that enables the automated system testing of desktop, web and mobile applications at the GUI level.\n\n\nWith Testar, you can start testing immediately. It automatically generates and executes test sequences based on a structure that is automatically derived from the UI through the accessibility API. Testar can detect the violation of general-purpose system requirements and you can use plugins to customize your tests.\n\n\nYou do not need test scripts and maintenance of it. The tests are random and are generated and executed automatically.\n\n\nIf you need to do directed tests you can create scripts to test specific requirements of your application.\n\n\nTestar is included in the devonfw distro or can be downloaded from https://testar.org/download/.\n\n\nThe Github repository can be found at o: https://github.com/TESTARtool/TESTAR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
