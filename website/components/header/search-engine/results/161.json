Detailed guides on multiple topics can be found here.\n\n\nDue to the large selection, getting started can be difficult for developers.\nIn this guide we aim to provide a general suggestion on basic frameworks, libraries, and technologies to make it easy for developers to begin with.\n\n\nWith that said, please take this as a recommendation and not as a compulsion. Depending on your project requirements, you might have to use another stack compared to what is listed below.\n\n\nIf you are new to Quarkus, consider checking out their getting started guide to get an overview of how to create, run, test, as well as package a Quarkus application. Another recommended source to get started is the Katacoda tutorials.\n\n\nBasic templates\n\n\n\nsimple REST API (go to code.quarkus.io)\n\n\nsimple REST API with monitoring (go to code.quarkus.io)\n\n\n\n\nTable 44.
