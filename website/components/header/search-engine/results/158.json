With Java modules there are changes and impacts you need to know to get things working. The most important change is documented in the JavaDoc of ResourceBundle. However, instead of using ResourceBundleProvider and refactoring your entire code causing incompatibilities, you can simply put the resource bundles in a regular JAR on the classpath rather than a named module (or into the lauching app).\nIf you want to implement (new) Java modules with i18n support, you can have a look at mmm-nls.\n\n\n\n\nBuildtime Changes\n\nIf you also want to change your build to work with a recent JDK you also need to ensure that test frameworks and maven plugins properly support this.\n\n\nFindbugs\n\nFindbugs does not work with Java 9+ and is actually a dead project.\nThe new findbugs is SpotBugs.\nFor maven the new solution is spotbugs-maven-plugin:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Frameworks\n\nTable 37.
