Usage of devon java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument(s)\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n…​\nany optional argument will directly be passed to the actual command to build the deployment\n\n\n\n\nBuild-Tools\n\nThis release commandlet utilizes the build commandlet to support multiple build-tools such as maven, gradle, or npm. Each of those commandlets should respect the variable «TOOL»_RELEASE_OPTS to customize the parameters for the release build.\n\n\nSo e.g. if a pom.xml is detected, maven will be used. In this example the variable MVN_RELEASE_OPTS is used that defaults to clean deploy -Dchangelist= -Pdeploy.\nIf you provide a specific argument this will be passed additionally.\nSo if you invoke the command devon release -P myProfile, the above step invoke deployment on build-system would technically call this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease also note that it is very tricky to determine and modify the version of a project in a fully generic way.\nEven though we try our best to support different scenarios, we can not ensure this is working for edge-cases.\nTherefore, we strongly encourage to follow best practices such as ci-friendly maven.\nFurther, sticking to the defaults and follow the devonfw standard to name the profile for custom goals in deployment simply deploy is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
