A guide about this process can be found here.\n\n\nOnce connected, run ipconfig on a console if you are using windows or ifconfig on a Linux machine to get the IP address of your machine’s Wireless LAN adapter WiFi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis obtained IP must be used instead of \"localhost\" or \"10.0.2.2\" at environment.android.ts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this configuration, follow the build steps in \"From Ionic to Android project\" and the first three steps in \"From Android project to emulated device\".\n\n\nSend APK to Android through USB\n\nTo send the built application to a device, you can connect computer and mobile through USB, but first, it is necessary to unlock developer options.\n\n\n\n\nOpen \"Settings\" and go to \"System\".\n\n\nClick on \"About\".\n\n\nClick \"Build number\" seven times to unlock developer options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to \"System\" again an then to \"Developer options\"\n\n\nCheck that the options are \"On\".\n\n\nCheck that \"USB debugging\" is activated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this, do the step four in \"From Android project to emulated device\" and choose the connected smartphone.\n\n\n\nSend APK to Android through email\n\nWhen you build an APK, a dialog gives two options: locate or analyze. If the first one is chosen, Windows file explorer will be opened showing an APK that can be send using email. Download the APK on your phone and click it to install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
