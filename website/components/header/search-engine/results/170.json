Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor transaction handling we AOP to add transaction control via annotations as aspect.\nThis is done by annotating your code with the @Transactional annotation.\nYou can either annotate your container bean at class level to make all methods transactional or your can annotate individual methods to make them transactional:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJTA Imports\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nHey there! Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nHere are the import statements for transaction support:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\nUse the above import statement to follow JEE and avoid using org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJTA Dependencies\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nHey there! Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nPlease note that with Jakarta EE the dependencies have changed.\nWhen you want to start with Jakarta EE you should use these dependencies to get the annoations for dependency injection:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that with quarkus you will get them as transitive dependencies out of the box.\nThe above Jakarate EE dependencies replace these JEE depdencies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandling constraint violations\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nHey there! Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nUsing @Transactional magically wraps transaction handling around your code.\nAs constraints are checked by the database at the end when the transaction gets committed, a constraint violation will be thrown by this aspect outside your code.\nIn case you have to handle constraint violations manually, you have to do that in code outside the logic that is annotated with @Transactional.\nThis may be done in a service operation by catching a ConstraintViolationException (org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException for hibernate).\nAs a generic approach you can solve this via REST execption handling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatches\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nHey there! Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nTransaction control for batches is a lot more complicated and is described in the batch layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
