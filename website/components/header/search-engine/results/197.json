Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor monitoring a complex application landscape it is crucial to have an exact overview which applications are up and running and which are not and why.\nIn devonfw we only focus on topics which are most important when developing production-ready applications.\nOn a high level view we strongly suggest to separate the application to be monitored from the monitoring system itself.\nTherefore, your application should concentrate on providing app specific data for the monitoring.\nAspects such as aggregation, visualization, search, alerting, etc. should be addressed outside of your app by a monitoring system product.\nThere are many products providing such a monitoring system like checkmk, icinga, SkyWalking, etc.\nPlease note that there is a huge list of such products and devonfw is not biased or aims to make a choice for you.\nInstead please search and find the products that fit best for your requirements and infrastructure.\n\n\n"}
