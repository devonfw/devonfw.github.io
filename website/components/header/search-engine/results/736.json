These are explained by the following table:\n\n\nTable 8. Variables of devonfw-ide for Eclipse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nECLIPSE_VERSION\nThe version of the tool Eclipse to install and use.\n\n\nECLIPSE_EDITION_TYPE\nThe edition of the tool Eclipse to install and use. You can choose between Java for standard edition or JEE for enterprise edition.\n\n\n*EXTRA_JAVA_VERSION\nYou can set this to a different (newer) version of Java used to launch your IDE (other than JAVA_VERSION that is used to build your project)\n\n\n\n\nplugins\n\nTo be productive with Eclipse you need plugins. Of course devonfw-ide can automate this for your:\nIn your settings git repository create a folder eclipse/plugins (click on this link to see more examples and see which plugins come by default).\nHere you can create a properties file for each plugin. This is an example tmterminal.properties:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variables are defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\nplugin_url defines the URL of the Eclipse update site of the plugin\n\n\nplugin_mirror_url defines the URL of the Eclipse mirrored update site of the plugin. See Mirroring Eclipse Update Site\n\n\nplugin_id defines the feature group ID(s) to install. To install multiple features/plugins provide a coma-separated list of IDs. If you want to customize devonfw-ide with new plugins you can first install them manually and then go to About Eclipse &gt; Installation Details then you can filter for your newly installed plugin and find the values in the Id column. Copy &amp; paste them from here to make up your own custom config.\n\n\nplugin_active is an optional parameter. If it is true (default) the plugin will be installed automatically during the project setup for all developers in your team. Otherwise, developers can still install the plugin manually via devon eclipse add-plugin «plugin-name» from the config file settings/eclipse/plugins/«plugin-name».properties. See the settings/eclipse/plugins folder for possible values of «plugin-name».\n\n\n\n\nIn general you should try to stick with the configuration pre-defined by your project. But some plugins may be considered as personal flavor and are typically not predefined by the project config. This e.g. applies for devstyle that allows a real dark mode for eclipse and tunes the theming and layout of Eclipse in general. Such plugins should be shipped with your settings as described above with plugin_active=false allowing you to easily install it manually.\n\n\nAs the maintainer of the settings for your project you should avoid to ship too many plugins that may waste resources but are not used by every developer. By configuring additional plugins with plugin_active=false you can give your developers the freedom to install some additional plugins easily.\n\n\nlegacy plugin config\n\nFor downward compatibility we still support the deprecated legacy configuration if the folder settings/eclipse/plugins does not exist:\nThe project configuration typically defines the plugins that will be installed via ECLIPSE_PLUGINS variable. Otherwise defaults from this eclipse commandlet will apply.\nBe aware that this comes at your own risk and sometimes plugins can conflict and break your IDE.\n\n\nHere is an example how a project can configure the plugins in its devon.properties inside the settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the above listed plugins you can also use the short form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course you may also mix plugin IDs with fully qualified plugins.\n\n\n\nmirroring update sites\n\nA common problem with eclipse plugins is that they are provided decentralized as so-called update sites via URLs.\nThe maintainer of that URL is in full control of the availability and the content behind that URL.\nIf the service gets broken, obviously the plugin can not be downloaded.\nEven worse, if existing content gets updated, the result is not reproducible anymore.\n\n\nWhile the plugin artifact itself is versioned, the request to install a plugin can not specify a version but always downloads the \"latest\" version from the update site.\nIf at all some kind of versioning for stability is in place it happens via the URL itself so for different major versions different URLs are provided.\nA possible solution is to mirror the update site locally and then make it available on your own webserver.\nThis way you always have access to the plugin version you need as a developer without being dependent on the plugin provider.\nBelow is the process to mirror a plugin update-site.\n\n\nTo mirror with only one paramter, you just need the «plugin-id» of an existing plugin in ${DEVON_IDE_HOME}/settings/eclipse/plugins (e.g. checkstyle).\nOpen any CLI in ${DEVON_IDE_HOME} and run the following command.\n\n\ndevon eclipse mirror «plugin-id» [«url»]\n\n\nThis command will automatically mirror the content of an update site to a specific directory named by «plugin-id» together with the current date in ${DEVON_DOWNLOAD_DIR}/update-sites/ (e.g. checkstyle-2022-09-14).\nAfterwards, the folder can be uploaded to your own webserver and the URL can be put manually in «plugin_mirror_url» in the «plugin-id».properties file.\nThis only works if a valid plugin_url is already set in the properties for the given plugin_id (see plugins).\nIf you want to mirror an update site independently of «plugin-id».properties, you can enter an update site URL for the optional «url» parameter (e.g. https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs-update-site).\n\n\n\n\ndictionary\n\nEclipse already comes with a build-in spellchecker. This is very helpful when writing comments. The default settings of devonfw-ide ship with a project specific dictionary file and according configurations to enable spellchecking and configuring this dictionary.\nWhen typing JavaDoc, inline comments or other texts the spellchecker will underline unknown words in red.\nIf your cursor is located at such a word you can hit [Ctrl][1] to get a context menu with additional options.\nThere you can either choose similar correct words to correct a typo or you may even add the word (maybe a new business term) to your local dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the latter case, you should commit the changes to your settings so that it will be available to your entire team.\nFor further details about committing changes to the settings please consult the admin usage.\n\n\nnon-english dictionary\n\nIn case your project has to write documentation or text in languages other than English, you might want to prefill your project dictionary for that language.\nHere we collect a list of such dictionaries that you can download and merge into your project dictionary:\n\n\n\n\nGerman: https://sourceforge.net/projects/germandict/ (has to be converted to UTF-8 e.g. with Notepad++ via Encoding &gt; Convert to UTF-8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
