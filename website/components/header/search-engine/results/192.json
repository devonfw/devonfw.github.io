Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn devon4j, we propose to use Spring Data JPA to build the data access layer using repositories and Querydsl to build dynamic queries. We will also use this approach for Quarkus applications, but we need to change the implementation because the devon4j modules are based on reflection, which is not suitable for Quarkus.\nIn Quarkus we will use Querydsl using code generation. So for this layer, more changes are required and we can’t just take the existing code.\n\n\nFirst, create a repository interface for your entity class that extends JpaRepository (see here).\n\n\nTo add QueryDSL support to your project, add the following dependencies to your pom.xml file:\n\n\nListing 26. pom.xml\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, we will use QueryDSL with code generation. For this, add the QueryDSL annotation processor to your plugins:\n\n\nListing 27. pom.xml\n\n\n\n\n\nTo implement the queries, follow the corresponding guide.\n\n\nSet the following properties in the application.properties file to configure the connection to your database (see also here):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
