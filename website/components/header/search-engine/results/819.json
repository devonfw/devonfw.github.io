The class contains all required web elements like buttons, textfields, labels, etc. When initializing a new project, create a new package to store the Page Object Models in.\n\n\nInitialization\n\nSource folder: allure-app-under-test/src/main/java\n\n\nName: com.example.selenium.pages.YOUR_PROJECT\n\n\nClasses being created inside of this new package have to extend the BasePage class. As a result, a few abstract methods from BasePage have to be implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe example above demonstrates a minimum valid Page Object class with all required methods included.\n\n\nBasePage method: isLoaded\n\nThe inherited method isLoaded() can be used to check if the current Page Object Model has been loaded correctly. There are multiple ways to verify a correctly loaded page. One example would be to compare the actual page title with the expected page title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasePage method: load\n\nThe method load() can be used to tell the webdriver to load a specific page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasePage method: pageTitle\n\nThe pageTitle() method returns a String containing the page title.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a selector variable\n\nTo initialize web elements, a large variety of selectors can be used.\n\n\nWe recommend creating  a private and constant field for every web element you’d like to represent in Java. Use the guide above to find the preferred selector and place it in the code below at \"WEB_ELEMENT_SELECTOR\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as you create the selector above, you can make use of it to initialize a WebElement object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The examples displayed in the cssSelector.docx file use the Selenium method driver.findElement() to find elements. However, using this framework we recommend  findDynamicElement() or findQuietlyElement().findDynamicElement() allows waiting for dynamic elements, for example buttons that pop up.\n\n\n\nCreating a page method\n\nTo interact with the page object, we recommend creating methods for each action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a method like the one above allows the test case to run something like googleSearchPage.enterGoogleSearchInput(\"Hello\") to interact with the page object.\n\n\n\nNaming Conventions\n\nFor code uniformity and readability, we provide a few method naming conventions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement\nAction\nName (example)\n\n\n\n\nForm: Input text\nenter\nenterUsernameInput()\n\n\n\nis (label)\nisUsernameInputPresent()\n\n\n\nis (value)\nisUsernameEmpty()\n\n\n\nget\ngetUsernameValue()\n\n\nForm: Label\nget\ngetCashValue()\n\n\n\nis (value)\nisCashValueEmpty()\n\n\n\nis (label)\nisCashLabelPresent()\n\n\nForm: Submit Button\nsubmit\nsubmitLoginForm()\n\n\n\nis\nisLoginFormPresent()\n\n\nPage: Button\nclick\nclickInfoButton()\n\n\n\nis\nisInfoButtonpresent()\n\n\nCheckbox\nset\nsetRememberMeCheckbox()\n\n\n\nunset\nunsetRememberMeCheckbox()\n\n\n\nis (present)\nisRememberMeCheckboxPresent()\n\n\n\nis (value)\nisRememberMeCheckboxSet()\n\n\nRadio\nset\nsetMaleRadioValue(\"Woman\")\n\n\n\nis (present)\nisMaleRadioPresent()\n\n\n\nis (visible)\nisMaleRadioVisible()\n\n\n\nget\ngetSelectedMaleValue()\n\n\nElements (Tabs, Cards, Account, etc.)\nclick\nclickPositionTab() / clickMyBilanceCard()\n\n\n\nis\nisMyBilanceCardPresent()\n\n\nDropdown List\nselect\nselectAccountTypeValue(typeName)\n\n\n\nunselect\nunselectAccountTypeValue(typeName)\n\n\n\nmultiple select\nselectAccountTypesValues(List typeNames)\n\n\n\nis (list)\nisAccountTypeDropdownListPresent()\n\n\n\nis (element present)\nisAccountTypeElementPresent(typeName)\n\n\n\nis (element selected)\nisAccountTypeSelected(typeName)\n\n\nLink\nclick\nclickMoreLink()\n\n\n\nis\nisMoreLinkPresent()\n\n\nCombobox\nselect\nselectSortCombobox()\n\n\n\nis (present)\nisSortComboboxPresent(name)\n\n\n\nis (contain)\nselectSortComboboxContain(name)\n\n\nElement Attribute\nget\ngetPositionTabCss()\n\n\n\nget\ngetMoreLinkHref() / getRememberMeCheckboxName()\n\n\n\n\nA css selector is used to select elements from an HTML page.\n\n\nSelection by element tag, class or id are the most common selectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis text element (p) can be found by using any one of the following selectors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing other attributes\n\nWhen a class or an id attribute is not sufficient to identify an element, other attributes can be used as well, by using \"[attribute=value]\": For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be selected by using the entire value: \"a[href='https://ns.nl/example.html'\\]\". For selecting links starting with, containing, ending with see the list below.\n\n\n\nUsing sub-elements\n\nThe css selectors can be stacked, by appending them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the link element to nsinternational can be obtained with: \"#2 a\".\n\n\n\nWhen possible avoid\n\n\n\nUsing paths of commonly used HTML elements within the containers (HTML: div). This will cause failures when a container is added, a common occurrence during development, e.g. \"div div p\". Use class or id instead, if those are not available, request them to be added in the production code.\n\n\nMagic order numbers. It is possible to get the second text element in its parent container by using the selector \"p:nth-child(2)\". If the items are representing different items, ask the developer to add specific attributes. It is also possible to request all items, with a selector similar to \".myList li\", and iterate through them later.\n\n\n\n\n\nList\n\nA good list with CSS Selectors can be found at W3Schools:\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp\n\n\n\n\nSelenium UFT Comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\nHP UFT\nHP LeanFT\nSelenium\nSelenium IDE\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\nVBScript\nSame as Selenium\nSupports several languages.\nJava\nJavascript\n\n\nLearning curve\nBased on VBScript which is relatively easy to learn\nLess intuitive, more coding knowledge necessary\nLess intuitive, more coding skills necessary\nRecord/playback possible.
