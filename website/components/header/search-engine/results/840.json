Derived from the PackageURL.\n\n\n2\nURL of the project, will be stored as sourceRepoUrl. (Optional: no change if not existing.)\n\n\n3\nLicenses to set. Optional. If defined then all found licenses will be replaced by the list of licenses given here.\n\n\n4\nSPDX identifier of license.\n\n\n5\nURL pointing to license text.\n\n\n6\nCopyrights to set. Optional. If defined then all found copyrights will be replaced by the list of copyrights given here.\n\n\n7\nA single copyright.\n\n\n8\nAnother copyright. Note that due to YAML syntax any string containing : needs to be enclosed with parentheses\n\n\n9\nFurther packages to follow.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision table rules\n\nAs for license information obtained from the Readers the license information from ScanCode can also be altered using decision table rules. A new attribute origin was introduced in the RawLicense entity as well as condition field in decision table LicenseAssignmentV2*.xls/csv. The origin attribute in Rawlicense either contains the string scancode if the license information came from ScanCode or it contains the (lowercase) class name of the used Reader.\n\n\nUsing the Extended comparison syntax it is possible to qualify whether a rule should apply for licenses found by ScanCode or not:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue of condition Origin\nrule applies for …​\n\n\n\n\nscancode\n…​ licenses obtained from ScanCode information\n\n\nNOT:scancode\n…​ licenses obtained from normal Readers\n\n\n(empty)\n…​ in both cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
