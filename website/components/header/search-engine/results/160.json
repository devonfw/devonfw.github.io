Ensure the extension is added to your pom.xml as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou additionally have to add the respective JDBC driver extension to your pom.xml. There are different drivers for different database types. See Quarkus Hibernate guide.\n\n\n\nDatabase System and Access\n\nYou need to configure which database type you want to use, as well as the location and credentials to access it. The defaults are configured in application.properties. The file should therefore contain the properties as in the given example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Logging\n\nAdd the following properties to application.properties to enable logging of database queries for debugging purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecrets and environment specific configurations\n\nEnvironment variables\n\nQuarkus reads configuration values from several locations, ordered by a certain priority. An overview of these can be found at the official  Quarkus config guide.\n\n\nEnvironment variables have a higher ordinal number and are therefore higher prioritized than e.g. the application.properties file.\nSo instead of storing secrets in plain text in the configuration files, it is better to use environment variables for critical values to configure the application.\n\n\nEnvironment variables also have the advantage that they can be easily integrated into a containerized environment.\nWhen using Kubernetes, the secrets can be stored as Kubernetes secret and then passed to the containers as an environment variable.\n\n\n\nCustom config sources\n\nQuarkus provides the possability to add custom config sources, which can be used to retrieve configuration values from custom locations.\nFor a description of this feature, see the corresponding Quarkus guide.\n\n\nConfig interceptors\n\nQuarkus also allows with the concept of interceptors to hook into the resolution of configuration values. This can be useful when configuration values are encrypted or need to be extracted.\nTo do this, you have to implement a ConfigSourceInterceptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the Interceptor, you must register it. To do this, create a file  io.smallrye.config.ConfigSourceInterceptor in the folder src/main/resources/META-INF/services and register the interceptor register the interceptor by writing the fully qualified class name to this file.\n\n\n\n\nCredential encryption\n\nAs for Spring, there are also some libraries that let Jasypt work with Quarkus such as Camel Quarkus Jasypt. Unfortunately, this feature only works in JVM mode and not in native mode, so it is not a suitable approach.\n\n\nIf you want to store usernames or passwords in encrypted form or retrieve them from a custom store, you can use a custom CredentialsProvider for this purpose.\nConsider the use case where you want to store your database credentials in encrypted form rather than in plain text. Then you can implement a credentials provider as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the application.properties file you need to set quarkus.datasource.credentials-provider=custom.\nFor more information about the credentials provider, see the official Quarkus guide.\n\n\n\nHashiCorp Vault\n\nFor centralized management of secrets and other critical configuration values, you can use HashiCorp Vault as external management tool.\n\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to integrate Vault into your Quarkus application, see the official Quarkus guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
